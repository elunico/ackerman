ackerman programs

me practicing my language skills. Also, I thought it would be cool to write the same program in a bunch of languages and see which is the shortest. 

According to GitHub CoffeeScript currently is using the least amount of the repository and C is using the most

I would like to eventually use these programs for some speed testing of various languages.
