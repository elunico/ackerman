ackermann programs

me practicing my language skills. Also, I thought it would be cool to write the same program in a bunch of languages and see which is the shortest. 

According to GitHub CoffeeScript currently is using the least amount of the repository and PHP is using the most (probably because it is in an HTML document)

I would like to eventually use these programs for some speed testing of various languages.
